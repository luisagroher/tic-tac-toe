# AI Tic Tac Toe
 
This is a repository for a python implementation of the tic-tac-toe game using the minimax algorithm. The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that recursively evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes, assuming optimal play from both players. 
This allows the AI to choose the move that minimizes the potential loss for a worst case scenario.
Future versions might include SARSA and Q-learning RL algorithms.  

## Features

- Command-line Tic Tac Toe game
- AI opponent using minimax algorithm
- Potential future implementation of Q-learning and SARSA

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
